| OULAD([Official](https://analyse.kmi.open.ac.uk/open-dataset))| released by the UK Open University for research in LA. It contains anonymized information about students and their study behavior in multiple online courses (“modules”), including demographic/background attributes, assessment details and grades, and detailed virtual learning environment (VLE) interaction logs (e.g., clicks on course resources over time). OULAD is widely used to study problems such as student performance prediction, dropout/retention modeling, and engagement analysis.|
| CodeWorkout([Official](https://sites.google.com/ncsu.edu/csedm-dc-2021/dataset))| The **CodeWorkout (CWO) open public dataset** is a real-world **introductory programming** dataset collected from the **CodeWorkout** online practice system. It contains anonymized logs of students’ **Java** code submissions for **50 coding problems** organized into **5 assignments** (used in Spring/Fall 2019 offerings of a CS1-style course). Each submission record typically includes fields such as **student ID**, **timestamp**, **assignment/problem IDs**, **compilation status / error message**, a **score (0–1) based on passed test cases**, and a pointer to the submitted code (via a code-state identifier). The release is commonly used for tasks like **knowledge tracing**, **early performance prediction**, and **learning-behavior analysis**, and it was also distributed as part of the **2nd CSEDM Data Challenge**.|
