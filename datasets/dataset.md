| OULAD([Official](https://analyse.kmi.open.ac.uk/open-dataset))| released by the UK Open University for research in LA. It contains anonymized information about students and their study behavior in multiple online courses (“modules”), including demographic/background attributes, assessment details and grades, and detailed virtual learning environment (VLE) interaction logs (e.g., clicks on course resources over time). OULAD is widely used to study problems such as student performance prediction, dropout/retention modeling, and engagement analysis.|
| CodeWorkout([Official](https://sites.google.com/ncsu.edu/csedm-dc-2021/dataset))| The **CodeWorkout (CWO) open public dataset** is a real-world **introductory programming** dataset collected from the **CodeWorkout** online practice system. It contains anonymized logs of students’ **Java** code submissions for **50 coding problems** organized into **5 assignments** (used in Spring/Fall 2019 offerings of a CS1-style course). Each submission record typically includes fields such as **student ID**, **timestamp**, **assignment/problem IDs**, **compilation status / error message**, a **score (0–1) based on passed test cases**, and a pointer to the submitted code (via a code-state identifier). The release is commonly used for tasks like **knowledge tracing**, **early performance prediction**, and **learning-behavior analysis**.|
| Higher Education Institution (HEI)([Official](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/697/predict%2Bstudents%2Bdropout%2Band%2Bacademic%2Bsuccess))|The dataset is from a higher-education institution (Polytechnic Institute of Portalegre, Portugal) built by merging several institutional databases. Each row is a student (4,424 instances) with 36 features including information available at enrollment (academic path, demographics, socio-economic factors) plus academic performance indicators from the end of the 1st and 2nd semesters. The prediction target is a 3-class outcome: dropout, enrolled, or graduate (imbalanced) | 
| Higher Education Student Performance (HESP)([Official](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/856/higher%2Beducation%2Bstudents%2Bperformance%2Bevaluation))|The higher education student performance dataset (HESP) from UC Irvine was collected from students in the faculty of engineering and educational sciences in 2019. The dataset consists of 145 instances and 31 attributes that cover demographic, academic, and behavioral features |
