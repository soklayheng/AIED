# Learning Analytic Dashboard (LAD)
  
| Objective | Dataset | AI model | Methods | Limitation | Ref |

| Propose a GenAI-based pipeline that automatically turns collaborative learning data into narrative feedback inside LDA | Recorded online meetings (MS Teams) from an OOP collaborative activity | Whisper for ASR, GPT-3.5 | GPT-3.5 to automatically code collaboration behaviours from class meeting transcripts (generated by whisper), automatically generate narrative summaries and feedback (data stories) for students and groups. Integrate these narratives output (JSON) into a GenAI-powered dashboard prototype | Accuracy will be based on transcibed scipts. Transcripts had to be split into 900-word chunks to fit GPT-3.5 constraints, which may cause loss of global context and affect coding accuracy.
