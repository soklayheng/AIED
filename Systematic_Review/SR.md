| Task | Type | Objective | Finding | Opportunity | Gap | Recommendation | Ref |
| ---------- | ------------ | -------------- | ------------------------- | ----------- | ---- | ---- |---- |
| GenAI in LA (Contextualising opportunities and challenges through LA Cycle) | Conceptualized Study | mapping its opportunities and challenges onto Clow’s LA (Learner → Data → Analytics → Interventions). Show how GenAI could augment LA at each stage:who/what is the learner, what data we collect, how we compute and present analytics, how we design interventions | need new conceptualisations of learners as “hybrid human-AI systems”, GenAI helps processing and analyzing data faster (multimodal), interaction trace for analyzis and present analysis using GenAI | Data: ASR for classroom transcription, Dynamic representations (multimodal data) with prompts, Synthetic data and simulated learners, Analytics: Unstructured data analysis, Personalised multimedia feedback, Data storytelling LAD, LLM-augmented dashboards can become conversational agents that: explain graphs, answer questions, suggest strategies and resources, support reflection and planning, Intervention: Personalized feedback, Accessibility (multimodal)| Hybrid human–AI learning paradigms,A dvanced analysis of unstructured learning data with GenAI, Personalized, adaptive, and interactive LAD | Ethical and equitable access concerns | [2024](https://github.com/soklayheng/AIED/blob/main/references/Yanetal-GenerativeAIinLearningAnalytics.pdf) |
| GenAI in LA (Mapping the Landscape of GenAI in LA) | Emperical Study | SR of how GenAI is concretely integrated (currently being used) across the full LA/EDM process cycle (Data, Pre-processing & preparation, Methods, analysis & tools, Implementation & action , Evaluation) | Data (data generation): generate synthetic datasets (imbalanced classes, and data privacy) using GAN and SMOTE, Pre-processing & preparation: Audio transcription: (learning interaction conversion); Automated discourse coding (BERT/GPT) for discussion posts, transcripts, interviews; Vector embeddings (BERT/Gemini/OpenAI embeddings), Text summarization (BERT or GPT-3.5 Turbo), Methods, analysis & tools: prediction (BERT), Automated scoring/grading (mostly BERT; also CLIP for handwritten math extraction), Tool development (OpenAI), Implementation & action: Dashboard (comic-based story or textual narrative explanations), Evaluation (GenAI integration effects): student perceptions (questionnaires/interviews) | GANs → synthetic data, BERT-family models → classification, scoring, embeddings, GPT-family models → discourse coding, summarisation, tool integration, conversational support. GenAI-augmented dashboards | “closing the loop”, GenAI is used without validating its output | validate the actual learning outcomes after AI intergration | [2025](https://github.com/soklayheng/AIED/blob/main/references/8591-Article%20Text-44355-2-10-20250327.pdf)|
| Explainable AI | Emperical Study | ------------ | -------------- | ------------------------- | ----------- | ---- | [2025](https://github.com/soklayheng/AIED/blob/main/references/Systematic_Literature_Review_on_Explainable_Learni.pdf) |
