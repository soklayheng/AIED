| Task | Type | Objective | Finding | Opportunity | Gap | Recommendation | Ref |
| ---------- | ------------ | -------------- | ------------------------- | ----------- | ---- | ---- |---- |
| GenAI in LA (Contextualising opportunities and challenges through LA Cycle) | Conceptualized Study | mapping its opportunities and challenges onto Clow’s LA (Learner → Data → Analytics → Interventions). Show how GenAI could augment LA at each stage:who/what is the learner, what data we collect, how we compute and present analytics, how we design interventions | need new conceptualisations of learners as “hybrid human-AI systems”, GenAI helps processing and analyzing data faster (multimodal), interaction trace for analyzis and present analysis using GenAI | Data: ASR for classroom transcription, Dynamic representations (multimodal data) with prompts, Synthetic data and simulated learners, Analytics: Unstructured data analysis, Personalised multimedia feedback, Data storytelling LAD, LLM-augmented dashboards can become conversational agents that: explain graphs, answer questions, suggest strategies and resources, support reflection and planning, Intervention: Personalized feedback, Accessibility (multimodal)| Hybrid human–AI learning paradigms,A dvanced analysis of unstructured learning data with GenAI, Personalized, adaptive, and interactive LAD | Ethical and equitable access concerns | [2024](https://github.com/soklayheng/AIED/blob/main/references/Yanetal-GenerativeAIinLearningAnalytics.pdf) |
